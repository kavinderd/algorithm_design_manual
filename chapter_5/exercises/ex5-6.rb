# Exercise 5-6
### Problem ###
# In breadth-first and depth-first search, an undiscovered node is marked discovered when it is
# first encountered, and makred processed when it has been completely searched. At any given moment, several
# nodes might be simultaneously in the discovered state.
# a) Describe a graph on n vertices and a particular starting vertex v such that Ө(n) nodes are simultaneously
#    in the discovered state during a breadth-first search starting from v.
# b) Describe a graph on n vertices and a particular starting vertex v such that Ө(n) nodes are simultaneously
#    in the discovered state suring a depth-first search starting from v
# c) Describe a graph on n vertices and a particular starting vertex v such that at some point Ө(n) nodes remain
#    undiscovered while Ө(n) nodes have been processed during a depth-first starting from v (Note, there may also
#    be discovered nodes)
### End ###
#  
#  Huh?
