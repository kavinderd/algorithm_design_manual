# Exercise 5-1
### Problem ###
# For the following graphs G1 and G2
# a) report the order of the vertices encountered on a breadth-first search starting from vertex A. Break all ties by picking the vertices in alphabetical order.
# b) report the order of the vertices necountered on a depth-first search starting from vertex A. Break all ties by picking the vertices in alphabetical order.
### End ###
#
# a) G1 = A,B,D,I,C,E,G,J,F,H
#    G2 = A,B,E,C,F,I,D,G,J,M,H,K,N,L,O,P
#
# b) G1 = A,B,C,E,D,F,H,G,I,J
#    G2 = A,B,C,D,H,G,F,E,I,J,K,L,P,O,N,M
