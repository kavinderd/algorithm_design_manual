# Exercise 6-14
### Problem ###
# The single-destination shortest path problem for a directed graph seeks the shortest path from every vertex
# to a specified vertex v. Give an efficient algorithm to solve the single-destination shortest paths problem
### End ###
#
# - Run Dijkstra's algorithm for each vertex from that vertex to the destination vertex.
# Will implement later
