# Exercise 6-24
### Problem ###
# A matching in a graph is a set of disjoint edges. i.e. edges that do not share
# any vertices in common. Give a linear-time algorithm to find a maximum matching 
# in a tree
### End ###
# 
# iterate over every vertex
# if that vertice is in the set skip it
# else add one of its edges to another vertex that's also not in the set
#
# Will implement later
