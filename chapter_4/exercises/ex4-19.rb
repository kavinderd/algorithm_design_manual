# Exercise 4-19
### Problem ### 
# An inversion of a permutation is a pair of elements that are out of order.
#
# a) Show that a permutation of n items has at most n(n-1)/2 inversions. Which 
# permutation(s) have exactly n(n-1)/2 inversions?
#
# b) Let P be a permutation and P^r be the reversal of this permutation. Show that P
# and P^r have a total of exactly n(n-1)/2 inversions.
#
# c) Use the previous result to argue that the expected number of inversions in a 
# rendom permutation is n(n-1)/4
### End ###
#
# a) Given the array a permutation of [4,2,6] there must be 3 possible inversions:
