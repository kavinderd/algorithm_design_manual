# Exercise 4-40
### Problem ###
# If you are given a million integers to sort, what algorithm would you use to sort them?
# How much time and memory would that consume?
### End ###
# 
# I would use mergesort or another algorithm in the nlogn class of algorithms. An optimal 
# solution would take O(nlogn) and O(n) space.
