# Exercise 4-39
### Problem ###
# Design and implement a parallel sorting algorithm that distributes data across several processors. An appropriate variation of mergesort
# is a likely candidate. Measure the speedup of this algorithm as the number of processors increases. Later, compare the execution time
# to that of a purely sequential mergesort impelemntation. What are your experiences?
### End ###
# Come back to this later
