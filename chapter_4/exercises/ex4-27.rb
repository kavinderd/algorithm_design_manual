# Exercise 4-27
### Problem ###
# Let P be a simple but not necessarily convex, polygon and q an arbitrary point not necessaryily in P. Design an 
# efficient algorithm to find a line segment originating from q that intersects the maximum number of edges of P. Inother
# words, if standing at point q, in what diretion should you aim a gun so the bullet will through the largest number
# of walls. A bullet through a vertex of P gets credit for only one wall. An O(nlogn) algorithm is possible.
### End ###

# Huh?
