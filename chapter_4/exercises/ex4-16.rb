# Exercise 4-16
### Problem ###
# Use the partioning idea of a quicksort to give an algorithm that finds the median
# element of an array of n integers in expected O(n) time. (Hint: must you look at 
# both sides of the partition?)
### End ###
#
# Given an array [0,9,5,3,2,8,1,6,7] that is out or order with a median of 5 we can partition 
# the array once around a pivot at n/2. In our example we would end up with
# [0,1,2,9,5,3,8,6,7], ????
